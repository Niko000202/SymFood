## 📢 News
* **[2026-02]** Trainging code is released!
* **[2026-02]** Our paper has been accepted by IEEE TCSVT!

## 📂 Data Preparation

Please organize your dataset directory as follows:

```text
SyMFood/
├── data/
├── dataset/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── zsd_annotations/
│   └── visual_prompts/
├── zsd_detr/
└── ...

```

## 🛠️ Environment Requirements

We strongly recommend using **Anaconda** to manage the environment. The dependencies are specified in `environment.yaml`.

* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.12.1 + CUDA 11.3
* MMDetection (2.x) + MMCV (2.x)
* Detectron2 / Detrex (for feature extraction components)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/SyMFood.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/SyMFood.git)
cd SyMFood

# Create the environment from the yaml file
conda env create -f environment.yaml

# Activate the environment
conda activate symfood

```

## 🚀 Training

We provide two ways to train the model. Please ensure you have properly set up the environment and dataset paths in `zsd_detr/configs/config.py` before running.

### Option 1: Training with Shell Script (Recommended)

You can simply run the provided shell script:

```bash
sh train.sh

```

### Option 2: Training with Python Command

Alternatively, you can manually run the training script with specific arguments:

```bash
python train_net.py --config-file zsd_detr/configs/config.py --num-gpus 1

```

## ⚡ Inference / Evaluation

To evaluate the model (Zero-Shot Detection performance) using the trained weights, run the following command:

```bash
python train_net.py --eval_only True --config-file zsd_detr/configs/config.py --num-gpus 1

```

## ⚠️ Notes

* If you are using Docker, ensure **CUDA 11.3** (or compatible) is available in the container.
* Update dataset and pretrained backbone paths in the config files before running any scripts.
